# Heart Disease Classification Using Machine Learning Models



   **Thing we are going to cover:**

         *  Problem Definition
         *  Data
         *  Model
         *  Evaluation
         *  Fine tuning

* This tries to use various machine learning and data science libraries to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether someone has a heart disease or not based on their medical attributes.
**Our goal is to predict whether or not people have heart disease using clinical parameters.**
* Loading Dataset
* Data Exploration (EDA)
* Crosstab and Correlation Matrix
* Modelling

      We are going to use 3 different machine learning models:
          *  Logistic Regression
          *  K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier
          *  Random Forest Classifier

* Model Comparison
* Hyperparameter Tuning

      You can fine tune your model by,
        *  hand
        *  RandomizedSearchCV
        *  GridSearchCV

* Evaluating the Models

        *  Confusion Matrix
        *  Classification Report
        *  Precision
        *  Recall
        *  F1-score
        *  The ROC Curve

And we will try to use this methods to fine tune our models.
